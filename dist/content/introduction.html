    Manifolds are fundamental mathematical objects that have become increasingly important 
    in machine learning and artificial intelligence. A manifold is a topological space 
    that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point. 
    This local Euclidean structure makes manifolds particularly useful for understanding 
    high-dimensional data and the internal representations of neural networks.

    The study of manifolds in machine learning has revealed that many high-dimensional 
    datasets actually lie on or near low-dimensional manifolds embedded in the ambient space 
    <d-cite bibtex-key="tenenbaum2000global"></d-cite>. This observation has led to the development 
    of manifold learning algorithms such as Locally Linear Embedding <d-cite bibtex-key="roweis2000nonlinear"></d-cite> 
    and Laplacian Eigenmaps <d-cite bibtex-key="belkin2003laplacian"></d-cite>, which aim to 
    discover the underlying manifold structure of data.

    More recently, researchers have begun to understand that the internal representations 
    of deep neural networks also exhibit manifold-like structures. 
    This has opened up new avenues for interpretability and understanding of how these 
    models process information. The interactive visualization above demonstrates how 
    neural network activations can be thought of as points on curved surfaces in 
    high-dimensional space.
